From vitals to verdict: predicting heart disease risk in seconds with machine learning and Streamlit.


# ü´Ä Heart Risk Prediction ‚Äì 10-Year Cardiovascular Risk Estimation  
### Powered by Machine Learning & Streamlit

> **"Predict today. Prevent tomorrow."**

This repository presents a machine learning pipeline to estimate the **10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)** by analyzing critical health parameters like:

- üßì **Age**
- üíâ **Cholesterol**
- üö¨ **Smoking**
- üî¥ **Blood Pressure**
- üç¨ **Diabetes**

By identifying high-risk individuals early, this project promotes **preventive care and informed health decisions**.

## üîç Project Workflow

üí° This project follows a **5-step data science pipeline**:

1. üßπ **Data Preparation**  
   - Missing value imputation, outlier treatment, and encoding.

2. üìà **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, and health patterns.

3. üß† **Feature Engineering**  
   - Selecting impactful predictors for CHD risk.

4. ü§ñ **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Applied machine learning models and tuned performance metrics.

5. üíæ **Model Saving & Deployment**  
   - Exported the model for integration into real-world apps.

## üìä Key Insights from EDA

‚úÖ **Age & Smoking** are leading risk factors.  
‚úÖ **High BP and Cholesterol** significantly correlate with CHD.  
‚úÖ **Diabetic individuals** show increased vulnerability.  
‚úÖ The model highlights patterns useful for **preventive screenings**.

> üìå These insights underline the importance of **early intervention and health awareness**.
